# Spring Boot REST API Endpoints

This project is a Spring Boot application that
implements RESTful endpoints to provide data and 
perform operations. It follows best practices for 
REST API design, leveraging Spring Boot’s 
capabilities for dependency injection, input validation, 
and ease of configuration, etc.

## Features

- RESTful endpoints for managing students list
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Data validation
- Dependency injection using Spring Boot
- Easily configurable properties in `application.properties`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17
- Maven for dependency management
- An MySQL database 

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/Idokoken/restendpoints.git
